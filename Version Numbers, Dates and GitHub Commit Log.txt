07-13-22 Scene Removal Committ
I removed a temporary scene I created while testing colliders and physics on my hand objects.  Those assets are now part of the main scene (still in beta testing) so having a second scene for testing is unnecessary.

* Updated Interaction Board
* Updated Welcome Boards
* Hid Interactive Menu and Added Button In Welcome Menu to Show
* Added Button on Wall By Table To Show Welcome Menu Once Closed
* Fixed Teleportation Anywhere Layer and Fixed Teleportation Limited (the Teleportation Anywhere Plane Height Was Causing Issues)
* Hid Teleportation Mat Mesh Renderer to Neaten Up Room
* Added Two More Mats (One By New Cabinet With Drawer and One By Punch Lists With Correct Direction)
* Added Cabinet With Drawer and Made Drawer and Cabinet Door Function
* Moved Front Door Teleportation Collider and Started to Work on Collider Script To Load New Scene.  This Isn't Working Quite Yet, However.

This commit has a working XR Rig Character Controller that follows the main camera's X and Z axis.  This prevents peeking through walls and clipping through walls as well as shrinking the Y transform of the character controller while physically ducking.

The collision script to reload the scene when walking through the front door continues and recent changes need to be tested with the HMD.

Fixed the crashing when going through the front door transporter (loading another scene).
Found the ideal position for the front door transporter collider.
Fixed the anti-cheating script so that this only occurs when colliding with walls and not furniture.

Collider Scene Loader Script Unity Editor Crash Bug Squashed.
Set the collider to the ideal position in the white lightbox room outside the front door.
Added a pushable button to the peaceful nowhere scene that takes users can press down with their hand.  It makes a click noise when pressed down and it loads the Matts Room scene upon release.
I also added a custom gold glitter shader for the pedestal, button and button base.

Worked on trying to fix the front door rubber banding hinge problem but didn't completely solve it.  I did make changes to the hinges, door and surrounding wall in the process.
Fixed various other bugs including "X" button position on Settings, Welcome and Interaction boards.
Fixed a few interaction board font issues (to remove glow effect on text mesh pro).
Added a fifth punch list (as I filled the previous four).  Added new socket for this and filled in additional bugs that need fixed and some new ideas of things to add (as well as adding items for mechanics and features I added to this world, previously.

This commit contains the physical hands being activated (they were always part of the hierarchy but not previously activiated and not linked in the hand controllers due to a  bug that caused your physical body to raise up to the ceiling whenever an interactable was grabbed.  That bug is squashed and the hands with colliders and physics are now enabled by default and the non-physics hands are disabled and unlinked.

I also changed the structure by duplicating my left and right hand controllers and linking the physical hands to two and the non-physical hands to the other two.  This way linking each time wasn't necessary.  Now I've disabled the non-physical hand controllers and hands and if I ever need to enable them again, I can do so in the hierarchy without any other setup.

There are still a few things with the physical hands I haven't yet figured out that I am working on.  Mainly the hands are not colliding with furniture, doors or walls yet (although I haven't yet figured out the reason why has the collision matrix has been set to allow collisions there and the direct interactable doesn't have any layer exclusions set).

I added two buttons to my room.  One I gave an all glass look to by changing the mesh render for those components.  This one has the text RESET and is on the counter.  When pressed it activates a script that resets the room.  Handy for HTC Vive users as they don't have a Y or B secondary button they can press to reset this room on their controllers.

The second button I gave a gray base with a red button and a different font and this one is labeled OPEN.  This button calls a function in another script that opens the door 100% (-130 degrees) when pressed.  Users can also open the door using the door knob but this gives two examples of physical buttons that carry out two different functions.

I also fixed a few more bugs in the room and slightly moved a few game objects around slightly.

I found and fixed a bug with the checklists (two toggles were not aligned properly with the fourth check list previously, now they are).

* Added a free 3D head model from Sketchfab (https://sketchfab.com/3d-models/head-planes-reference-7b6167ae3e484f1884ae0491a491e856) and I scaled and attached this to my main camera.
* Added a free Dalek 3D model from Sketchfab (https://sketchfab.com/3d-models/bronze-new-series-dalek-rigged-f4b5e527d478485f975aa9f9193248be), I scaled this and made it an XR Grab Interactable for the coffee table.

* Added the free "bronze-new-series-dalek-rigged" model from Sketchfab (https://sketchfab.com/3d-models/bronze-new-series-dalek-rigged-f4b5e527d478485f975aa9f9193248be), scaled this down and made this an XR Grab Interactable for the coffee table.
* Added the free "head-planes-reference" model from Sketchfab (https://sketchfab.com/3d-models/head-planes-reference-7b6167ae3e484f1884ae0491a491e856), scaled this up and attached this to the main camera as a head in VR.

* Changed borrowed OpenDoor script (that opens the door from 0 to 100 completely in one button press) to a script that enacts the HingeJoint motors to open the door gradually.  Door can still be opened and closed manually, as well.
* Moved Dalek game object under the --DYNAMIC-- empty game object and alphabetized.

*Adjusted wall colliders.
*Separated wall colliders into separate game objects to make it easier to adjust, resize and show one collider at a time for troubleshooting.
* Fixed Dalek Grab Interactable glitch (was spinning when held).
* Fixed head clipping into view by moving head object back just far enough until no longer clipping.
* Fixed top hat and captain hat attach point so that both hats sat correctly on mannequin head object.
* Tried to fix "open" push button limit so that button did not push in so far, but I have been (so far) unable to correct this.
* Tried to fix walls so that hands do not clip through but so far hands still clip through walls.  This also allows me to manipulate/push the button towards me from the back end (bug).
*There is also an invisible collider that is preventing me from being able to throw the hats towards the hooks.  But so far I have not been able to determine which collider is doing this (bug).
*I was able to push back the collider on the north wall where the desk is so that throwing photos at the board is again successful (may need to adjust further to perfect).

Fixed a bug that one of my students found play testing on 11-03-22.  Under the correct circumstances when using teleport anywhere he was able to teleport himself outside the bounds of the room by placing the cursor between the room and the watering can.  I adjusted the teleportation anywhere plane so that there is now a  buffer on all four sides of floor and the outside walls in which teleportation is no longer possible.

I tested and I was not able to get out of bounds in the way found previous.

Papers can still clip through the floor and this does not appear to be due to this teleportation area layer.
